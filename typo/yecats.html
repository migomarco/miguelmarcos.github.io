<p>Former admissions counselor here. 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>A student wrote about his sister as an 
	inspiration, because she was only 4'11 and 
	unlikely to lead a normal life. As a fellow 
	shorty, this was eye-opening to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	A "Why I want to go to your college" essay 
	that compared an potential acceptance to 
	consummating a relationship with a lover. Ew.

<p>The most memorable essays were often about very simple moments in life, or relationships with parents/siblings/friends. They were memorable for being well-written, honest and authentic. In general, satire doesn't usually work. Sometimes it goes very, very badly.</p>

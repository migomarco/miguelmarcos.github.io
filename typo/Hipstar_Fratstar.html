<div class ="essay">

<p>My sister went to Yale and this is a story about one of her friends. He was the son of a famous actor and so he could be a bit more cavalier about his essay than most. 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>Yale's essay prompt was "Why Yale?". 
<br/>
<br/>
    My sister's friend simply wrote "Dear 
	Yale, you're great. There's no need to 
	fish for compliments".</p> 
    </div>

<p>When my sister's friend met the Dean of his College during the first week of school, the Dean remarked "I really enjoyed your essay". My sister's friend was quite flabbergasted and simply turned around and walked away.</p>

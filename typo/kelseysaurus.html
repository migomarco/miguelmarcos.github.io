<div class ="essay">

<p>For my high school admissions essay (yes, really), 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>I wrote about how I wanted to attend because I 
	would be riding the bus for an hour every day 
	(Yes. Really.). I was accepted. 
</p> 
    </div>

<p>Additionally, for my college acceptance essays, 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>I wrote about how the video game character 
	Pajama Sam was my personal hero. Accepted 
	to 3/4 and waitlisted at the 4th. 
</p> 
    </div>

<p>I was really lucky to have kind of a troll mom who encouraged both of these tacks, and am pretty sure they're what made me stand out enough to be accepted in both situations, since I'm kind of a run of the mill white female, and was never really outstanding in academia.</p>

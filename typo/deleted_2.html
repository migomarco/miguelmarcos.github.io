<div class ="essay">

<p>When I was working in admission at a University, I dealt strictly with international students. 
 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>	I had a young woman who applied to the 
	University and was looking for a scholarship 
	(about 20 to 25% of all international applicants 
	cannot afford the fees and request a full 
	scholarship. Less than 1% of those applicants 
	receive it).  
<br/>
<br/>
    She wrote how we could take her passport and 
	make her work/live at school until her debt had 
	been paid-off. She went into great detail about 
	how she was okay living in a cupboard and 
	she'd only ask to be let free once a month, but 
	would absolutely return.
</p> 
    </div>

<p>Needless to say, her request was denied.</p>

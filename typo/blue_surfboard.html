<div class ="essay">

<p>Actual admissions counselor here, and this thread couldn't come at a more appropriate time. Anyhow, one essay that stands out to me is one from last year. One girl last year, who already had an older sister enrolled at our college, chose the topic that's something like,  

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>tell us about when you knew you 
	transitioned into adulthood. 
<br/>
<br/>
    She decided to write her essay and tell 
	me that she knew she became an adult 
	when she learned the invaluable skill of 
	brushing her teeth and taking a dump at 
	the same time.</p> 
    </div>

<p>No, I was not impressed.</p>

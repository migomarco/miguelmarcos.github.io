<p>This brother/sister pair who 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>simply wrote down a list of relatives who 
	had attended, and they wrote down their 
	GPA/average too. They didn't even answer 
	the prompt we gave them, and at the end 
	they wrote down something like "I hope I 
	can attend this college too". 
</p> 
    </div>

<p>Their GPA wasn't bad, it was actually pretty good, but we reject applications that have higher GPAs than them. I'm 99% sure they got accepted. I recognized their last names, their family donates 
a lot of money to the university.</p>

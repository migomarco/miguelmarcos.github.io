<div class ="essay">

<p>There's a prominent magnet school for Science and Technology in my area which most of the local "gifted" students apply to during middle school. 
I remember one of the application essays was something along the lines of  

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>"Should it be illegal to make fun of the 
	President of the United States?"  
<br/>
<br/>
    My response was basically "Yes, because the 
	President needs the support of the population 
	to effectively lead."</p> 
    </div>

<p>It wasn't until well after I was rejected that I realized I wrote an essay essentially defending dictatorships and restricting free speech. This was also YEARS before I really understood what political satire was. I was so pissed off at myself.</p>

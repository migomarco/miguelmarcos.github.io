<div class ="essay">

<p>My essay prompt was  

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>"What place are you happiest?" 
	or something like that. 
<br/>
<br/>
    I wrote about how my favorite place 
	to be is my sisters (both away in college 
	so it's not weird) room, because of the 
	superior air flow, not being in line with 
	the rising/setting sun, and how the door is 
	slightly too big for it's frame, giving me a 
	warning that someone is going to come 
	into room, so if I'm dancing, I can stop.</p>

<p>Adelphi gave me $75,000 over 4 years.</p>

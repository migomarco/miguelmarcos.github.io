<div class ="essay">

<p>I work as an admissions counselor at a lower end Ivy (think Cornell, Dartmouth, Columbia).
 
 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>We admitted one student who wrote about 
	how to brush his teeth. He hadn't learned 
	how to do it properly growing up, and when 
	he found out how to do it during his teen years, 
	his perspective on learning changed. 
</p> 
    </div>

<p>It was very profound and a very unique essay topic to write about. We liked it so much we let him in.</p>

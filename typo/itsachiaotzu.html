<div class ="essay">

<p>Not a counselor, but I assisted the head of the post baccalaureate program to help students get to med school. A prospective student sent in his application for the fall semester. 

    <div class="inessay">
   <p>His essay was all about his experience being 
	on the list for a new heart. He had been on 
	this list for years. He talked about feeling like 
	giving up at points, but he knew he would 
	get there. He wanted to become a doctor so 
	that he could help others. 
</p> 
    </div>

<p>It was a great essay. He was accepted into the program. He later called and asked if he could delay his acceptance to the spring semester because he was getting a new heart!</p>

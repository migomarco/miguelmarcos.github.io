		<h1> Reading week 3 </h1>
		<p> What I learnt from this reading is that one should keep testing and redesign. When developing a progam or design any project infact, you need other prespectives, because at the end of the day you're designing for the people, so you have to see what the people like. Critiqing is so important for that reason. Also, sometimes you have to change ideas comepletely, or even the target audience changes, just depending on the development and where it leads, but that could go of track, and that is why you have to find the purpose of what it is you're designing.</p>

		<h2> Week 13 </h2>
		<p>Watching this was very interesting. It opened my eyes to design for people with accessibility. I was thinking about how not all designs can compensate for people with accessibility, then when I actually thought of it, I imagined advertsing would be creative brail copyright, branding would be the feeling of the brail to the finger, and typography would be the layout of the brail. This can pretty much be applied to everything. I also like the idea of accessibility for the disable should be integrated with the peice rather than a seperate option, so that we all experience the same thing. When he navigated the audible iPhone was super impressive. i will never know how he listens that fast. </p>
